# Diploma_thesis_LK
Code for my diploma thesis.

.py are python files with different architectures that are executable after changing:
filling project name, changing paths to your local files with data

Work_file is my jupyter notebook file, where you can find most of my testing, how results are made into csv, ensemble, augmentation visuals etc.
Basically if there is something from the thesis you have questions about; you can probably find it there. Note that cells needs to be run in specific order so it might take a while to orient yourself in it. I left most of the usefull outputs visible so you might find what you need without executing it yourself.

Note that data exploration is jupyter notebook file and is not really optimised so it might take a while to finish.
